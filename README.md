Data Set used:

I created a simple dashboard using a data set from kaggle. The dashboard is made of two work sheets showing the top books by genre as a bar graph, and the top authors as a tree map. Ratings are based on the number of user submitted reviews per book/author. 
The two data sets are made into a dashboard where you can filter each based on genre, causing both charts to reflect the choosen genre.
